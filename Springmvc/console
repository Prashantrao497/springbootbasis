This is a simple Spring MVC project that demonstrates the basic flow of a web application built with Spring.
The application includes:

A home page with navigation links

A controller that handles requests

JSP views to display data

A basic form to collect input



Flow of Spring MVC

Client Request

A user clicks a link or submits a form (/greet, /welcome).

DispatcherServlet

The request is first received by Spring’s DispatcherServlet.

Defined in web.xml, it acts as the front controller.

Handler Mapping

Spring checks which @Controller and method should handle the request.

Controller

The controller method executes business logic (or calls the service layer).

It returns a view name (e.g., "greet").

View Resolver

Spring’s InternalResourceViewResolver maps the view name to a JSP file (e.g., greet.jsp).

View (JSP)

The JSP is rendered with data (if any) and the response is sent back to the browser.
